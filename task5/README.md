# Task5 - Comparative genomics - gene set comparison

This task is a tutorial on comparative genomics with a focus on gene set comparison.
You will learn how to identify gene duplications, gene gains and gene losses.
You will also learn how to compare functional profiles and identify functional categories (e.g., GO terms) that have changed in frequency between genomes.
