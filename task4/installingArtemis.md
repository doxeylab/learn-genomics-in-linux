# Installing Artemis/Java

Artemis Installation Instructions

## Part 1 - Install the Java Development Kit (JDK):
1.	Go to the [Temurin by Adoptium website](https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases/?version=11&os=windows&arch=x64&package=jdk) and select your operating system version (most systems run x64 bit).
2.	Select the "**JDK 11-LTS**" version from the dropdown menu. 
-	For Windows: Download the **.msi** file and run it once downloaded.
-	For MacOS: Download the **.pkg** file and run it once downloaded.

## Part 2 - Install Artemis Tools:
1.	Go to the [Sanger Pathogens website](https://sanger-pathogens.github.io/Artemis/) and scroll down the page until you reach the **"Software Availability"** section.
2.	Under the **"Download"** heading, select your operating system version from the list and download the file. 
-	For Windows: Download the **.zip** file.
-	For MacOS: Download the **.dmg** file.
3.	Unzip the file to an appropriate local directory and an Artemis folder will be created containing the tools. 
-	For Windows: Recommended to unzip the file to the **"C:\"** drive.
-	For MacOS: Recommended to unzip the file to the "**Applications**" folder.
The first time you run one of the tools, it will ask to "Set Working Directory". Ask your prof what to set this to as they probably have some files to get data from â€“ the working directory should be the one that contains those.
