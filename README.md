# learn-genomics-in-unix

This repository is an introductory tutorial on how to use command-line genomics/bioinformatics tools in Linux.

It is divided into a series of tasks

  * Task 1 - Learning the linux command line
  * Task 1b - Command-line BLAST
  * Task 2 - Genome Assembly
  * Task 3 - Genome Annotation
  * Task 4 - Comparative genomics: synteny comparison between two genomes
  * Task 5 - Comparative genomics: gene set comparison between two genomes
  * Task 6 - Metagenomics: taxonomic and functional profiling
  * Task 7 - Resequencing: variant calling from NGS data
  
# Requirements

The main requirement is that you have access to a Linux-based OS such as Ubuntu.
Most of the programs are text-based and can be run directly in the shell; however, some graphical programs (e.g., Tablet, Artemis, fastqc) are used which require GUI access.

Detailed software requirements are listed at the beginning of each Task.
We have also documented installation instructions for building a bioinformatics system (Ubuntu 18.04) [here](https://github.com/doxeylab/learn-genomics-in-unix/blob/master/VMbuild.README).
