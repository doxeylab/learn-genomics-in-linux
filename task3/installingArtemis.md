# Installing Artemis/Java

If you're having difficulty installing  Java & Artemis, please see the instructions below (via Science Computing) for installing the Java Development Kit. This has now been tested on multiple systems. If you still have difficulties after trying this, let us know, and we will put you in contact with Science Computing to help you individually.

Also, for mac users - if you get a security warning when opening the Artemis or ACT for the first time, try: Ctrl-click on the application and then Open. This will override the security error.

Go here: https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases/?version=11&os=windows&arch=x64&package=jdk

Select your OS information (almost everything is x64 now) and then “JDK 11 – LTS”
For Windows, download the .msi and run it
For Mac, download the .pkg and run it
Then, go to this page and scroll down a little to “Software Availability” and under “Download,” choose your OS

You will get a .zip folder. Unpack it to someplace that makes sense to you (I recommend someplace local to the machine, even Downloads – not sure if this will work with a cloud service, the .zip simply contains a series of binaries that leverage Java) – consider something like C:\Artemis

The first time you run one of the programs, it will ask to Set Working Directory. The working directory should be the one that contains the files you will be analyzing.
